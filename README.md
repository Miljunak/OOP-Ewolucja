# OOP-Ewolucja
Java animal simulation slightly resembling Convay's Game of Life.
The project involves creating a virtual world that evolves over time. It includes a simple world consisting of rectangular fields divided into squares. The majority of the world is covered in grasslands with sparse plant life, while some areas are jungles where plants grow faster. The animals in the world are herbivores, and they roam around in search of food. Each animal has a set amount of energy that decreases daily, and finding and eating plants increases their energy level.
The project has been written with usage of Gradle.
